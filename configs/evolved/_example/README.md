# Example config

This example config demonstrates how to create an evolved `server.cfg` file.

*Note: Introduce your config file here.*

## Based on file

https://github.com/quakelive-server-standards/quakelive-server-standards/blob/a5389437bfd2be4f02bbc2c1d89145b2e9bf8f9d/configs/standard/server.cfg

*Note: You need to base your `server.cfg` either on the [standard](https://github.com/quakelive-server-standards/quakelive-server-standards/tree/master/configs/standard) or on one of the [evolutions](https://github.com/quakelive-server-standards/quakelive-server-standards/tree/master/configs/evolved). Otherwise your pull request will not be accepted.*

*Note: To get this kind of link you need to open the file on the GitHub website. Then click on history at the top right side. Find the commit you want to refer to (usually the one on the top) and click the button with that file icon. Its tooltip will display the message "View at this point in the history". Now copy the link from the browser address bar.*

## Cvars

*Note: List the cvars you have changed here. Use the correct Markdown headline level 5.*

##### Hunk Megs

`com_hunkMegs 120` - Sets the amount of memory in mega bytes.

To support servers with 16 players this value is set to 120 mega bytes.

*Note: State the cvar and its value in the format `<cvar> <value>` and add some words to describe what it sets up. If you are not sure how to describe it use [this](http://www.regurge.at/ql/) cvar collection for an inspiration. Underneath describe why you set the variable to that value.*
