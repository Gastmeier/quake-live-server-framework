# Example factories file

This example factories file demonstrates how to create an evolved `*.factories` files.

*Note: Introduce your factories file here.*

## Based on file

https://github.com/quakelive-server-standards/quakelive-server-standards/blob/482a3e2e5fd9dd106f7221d1f12ae2df168e7610/factories/standard/duel/duel.factories

*Note: You need to base your `*.factories` file either on the [standard](https://github.com/quakelive-server-standards/quakelive-server-standards/tree/master/factories/standard) or on one of the [evolutions](https://github.com/quakelive-server-standards/quakelive-server-standards/tree/master/factories/evolved). Otherwise your pull request will not be accepted.*

*Note: Refer to the file by using a link which references a specific Git commit. You can get such a link by opening the file you want to refer to on the GitHub website. Then click on history at the top right side. Find the commit you want to refer to (usually the one on the top) and click the button with that file icon. Its tooltip will display the message "View at this point in the history". Now copy the link from the browser address bar.*

## Cvars

*Note: List the cvars that you added or changed in an alphabetical order. Use the correct Markdown headline level 4 by using `####`.*

##### Time limit

`timelimit 15` - The amount of time a match lasts.

Back to the old fashioned 15 minute time limit to facilitate comebacks and thus more exciting games.

*Note: State the cvar and its value in the format `<cvar> <value>` and add some words to describe what it sets up. If you are not sure how to describe it use [this](http://www.regurge.at/ql/) cvar collection for an inspiration. Underneath describe why you set the variable to that value.*
