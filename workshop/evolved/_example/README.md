# Example workshop item list

This example workshop item list demonstrates how to create an evolved `workshop.txt` file.

*Note: Introduce your workshop item list here.*

## Based on file

https://github.com/quakelive-server-standards/quakelive-server-standards/blob/ece697d788277555bb6f008c18d8734c57faeef4/workshop/standard/duel/workshop.txt

*Note: You need to base your `workshop.txt` either on the [standard](https://github.com/quakelive-server-standards/quakelive-server-standards/tree/master/workshop/standard) or on one of the [evolutions](https://github.com/quakelive-server-standards/quakelive-server-standards/tree/master/workshop/evolved). Otherwise your pull request will not be accepted.*

*Note: To get this kind of link you need to open the file on the GitHub website. Then click on history at the top right side. Find the commit you want to refer to (usually the one on the top) and click the button with that file icon. Its tooltip will display the message "View at this point in the history". Now copy the link from the browser address bar.*

## Workshop items

*Note: List the workshop itmes you have changed here. Use the correct Markdown headline level 5.*

##### Quake Live Extras Pack

Because these are the official extra arena id Software released by themselves, those should be available on a server.

*Note: State the Workshop id and add the link to the Workshop item. Underneath describe why you added that Workshop item.*
