# Example workshop item list

This example workshop item list demonstrates how to create an evolved `workshop.txt` file.

*Note: Introduce your workshop item list here.*

## Based on file

https://github.com/quakelive-server-standards/quakelive-server-standards/blob/ece697d788277555bb6f008c18d8734c57faeef4/workshop/standard/duel/workshop.txt

*Note: You need to base your `workshop.txt` either on the [standard](https://github.com/quakelive-server-standards/quakelive-server-standards/tree/master/workshop/standard) or on one of the [evolutions](https://github.com/quakelive-server-standards/quakelive-server-standards/tree/master/workshop/evolved). Otherwise your pull request will not be accepted.*

*Note: Refer to the file by using a link which references a specific Git commit. You can get such a link by opening the file you want to refer to on the GitHub website. Then click on history at the top right side. Find the commit you want to refer to (usually the one on the top) and click the button with that file icon. Its tooltip will display the message "View at this point in the history". Now copy the link from the browser address bar.*

## Evolutions

*Note: List the Workshop items that you added or changed in a numerical order.*

### 547937675 - Beatbox

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=539421606

*Note: State the Steam Workshop link to that item. Add an optional description underneath it.*

*Note: This is an example for a Workshop item that provides a map. In that case, list the one or the many maps underneath with their own headline.*

#### Beatbox

![Map image](../../_images/beatbox.jpeg)

Another map by the creator of Bloodrun.

In-game name: `beatbox`  
https://ws.q3df.org/map/ztn3dm2/  
https://lvlworld.com/overview/id:107  

*Note: Add the so called level shot of that map. You can find it by [downloading](https://github.com/quakelive-server-standards/quakelive-server-standards/tree/master/workshop#download-a-workshop-item) the Workshop item and extracting the `*.pk3` file with [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org). Scale it down to 637x358 pixel and add it to the [`_images`](https://github.com/quakelive-server-standards/quakelive-server-standards/tree/master/workshop/_images) directory. Reference the image in your `README.md` by using the Markdown code `![Map image](../../_images/beatbox.jpeg)`.*

*Note: Add a description for the map.*

*Note: Provide the in-game name which can be used when calling a vote in the Quake Live console.*

*Note: Search for the map on https://ws.q3df.org/ and on https://lvlworld.com. Provide the links to the map on both of these website if available.*

## History

*Note: Work in versions which increment with every change. Start at version 1. State what you have added or removed.*

### Version 2

*Note: Put a new version above the version before.*

### Version 1

#### Add: 539421606

Provide the players with the option to play on the Intel version of Bloodrun.

*Note: Just repeat the text that you already wrote from above. This repetition is for documenting the value and the reason for it because it might be changed or removed in the future.*

#### Remove: 691078677

Gibs are too brutal and should not be allowed.

*Note: State maps that you removed. Underneath describe why you removed it.*
