# Example map pool

This example map pool demonstrates how to create an evolved `mappool.txt` file.

*Note: Introduce your map pool file here.*

## Based on file

*Note: You do not need to base your `mappool.txt` on any file but you can base it either on one of the [standards](https://github.com/quakelive-server-standards/quakelive-server-standards/tree/master/mappools/standard) or on one of the [evolutions](https://github.com/quakelive-server-standards/quakelive-server-standards/tree/master/mappools/evolved).*

*Note: If you base you map pool on an existing file then you need to state it here. Refer to that file by using a link which references a specific Git commit. You can get such a link by opening the file you want to refer to on the GitHub website. Then click on history at the top right side. Find the commit you want to refer to (usually the one on the top) and click the button with that file icon. Its tooltip will display the message "View at this point in the history". Now copy the link from the browser address bar.*

## Maps

*Note: List the cvars that you added or changed in an alphabetical order. Use the correct Markdown headline level 4 by using `####`.*

#### Bloodrun Blue

`bloodrunblue` - Bloodrun Blue

Provide the players with the option to also be able to play on the Intel version of Bloodrun.

*Note: State the map ingame name which can be used for an in-game `callvote` command and add the full name afterwards. Underneath describe why you added that map.*
