# Example map pool

This example map pool demonstrates how to create an evolved `mappool.txt` file.

*Note: Introduce your map pool file here.*

## Based on file

https://github.com/quakelive-server-standards/quakelive-server-standards/blob/64ba2cc89ce67cd4d0496c3390127a006c64e384/mappools/standard/duel/mappool.txt

*Note: You need to base your `mappool.txt` either on the [standard](https://github.com/quakelive-server-standards/quakelive-server-standards/tree/master/mappools/standard) or on one of the [evolutions](https://github.com/quakelive-server-standards/quakelive-server-standards/tree/master/mappools/evolved). Otherwise your pull request will not be accepted.*

*Note: To get this kind of link you need to open the file on the GitHub website. Then click on history at the top right side. Find the commit you want to refer to (usually the one on the top) and click the button with that file icon. Its tooltip will display the message "View at this point in the history". Now copy the link from the browser address bar.*

## Maps

*Note: List the maps you have changed here. Use the correct Markdown headline level 5.*

##### Bloodrun Blue

`bloodrunblue` - Bloodrun Blue

Provide the players with the option to also be able to play on the Intel version of Bloodrun.

*Note: State the map ingame name which can be used for an in-game `callvote` command and add the full name afterwards. Underneath describe why you added that map.*
