// This server configuration file is empty because its values overrride values given as
// command line parameters. The reason for this is that we want the Docker image to be
// fully configurable without needing a server.cfg but through Docker environment variables.
// Which in turn are given as command line options to the Quake Live server executable.
// If this file would set any value it could not be overriden by the Docker configuration.

// The default values a particular server configuration of this framework determines are
// set through default values of their corresponding environment variables in the Docker file.
// This means that you have to duplicate these standard defaults.
