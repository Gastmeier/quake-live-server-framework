# Example minqlx plugin list

This example minqlx plugin list demonstrates how to create an evolved minqlx plugin directory.

*Note: Introduce your minqlx plugin list here.*

## Based on directory

https://github.com/quakelive-server-standards/quakelive-server-standards/tree/89ca0a79371017677a12dda7f28bc4db50c677c7/minqlx-plugins/standard/duel

*Note: You need to base your minqlx plugin directory either on the [standard](https://github.com/quakelive-server-standards/quakelive-server-standards/tree/master/minqlx-plugin/standard) or on one of the [evolutions](https://github.com/quakelive-server-standards/quakelive-server-standards/tree/master/minqlx-plugins/evolved). Otherwise your pull request will not be accepted.*

*Note: To get this kind of link you need to open the directory on the GitHub website. Then click on history at the top right side. Find the commit you want to refer to (usually the one on the top) and click the button with that file icon. Its tooltip will display the message "View at this point in the history". Now copy the link from the browser address bar.*

## Workshop items

*Note: List the workshop itmes you have changed here. Use the correct Markdown headline level 5.*

##### Quake Live Extras Pack

`539421606` - https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=539421606

Because these are the official extra arena id Software released by themselves, those should be available on a server.

*Note: State the Workshop id and add the link to the Workshop item. Underneath describe why you added that Workshop item.*
