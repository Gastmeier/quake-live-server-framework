# minqlx plugins

minqlx is an extension for the Quake Live server programmed by Mino which can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/MinoMino/minqlx). He himself describes it the following way.

> minqlx is a modification to the Quake Live Dedicated Server that extends Quake Live's dedicated server with extra functionality and allows scripting of server behavior through an embedded Python interpreter.

minqlx itself is extended by plugins which come in the form of Python files. This repository links all known plugin file sources as Git sub modules inside the `minqlx-plugins/_plugins` repository. If you ran the Git command `git submodule init` you will be able to browse through all the files of those.

There is also an [overview](https://github.com/quakelive-server-standards/quakelive-server-standards/blob/master/minqlx-plugins/_plugins#readme) over all known minqlx plugins sorted by topics.
